# Basic examples

This is the most basic and minimal example using [bloql](https://github.com/adriantoine/bloql). I doesn't have any styling or fancy routing, only a posts list and a post viewer.

## Installation

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`
- Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
- Enjoy
